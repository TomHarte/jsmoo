A few notes on compatability.

Where NTSC systems are available, only NTSC has been tested. PAL support is theoretical for most systems at this point. Obviously the ZX Spectrum is the PAL version since there is no NTSC version of any note.

Save states and SRAM are not a thing yet. Look for these to be added soon.

SNES
~~~~
Super Mario World is the only game to be tested extensively as working without PPU glitches, with the exception of Mode7 boss fights. This is an area I will work on in the future.

Link to the Past works, with some significant PPU glitches.

Only LoROM games will even load, no ExROM or games with expansion chips.

Tested as not working:
Super Metroid


NES

Due to the accuracy of implementation, all games with no mapper or MMC#3 should work, but I have not tested all games.

Tested working 100%
